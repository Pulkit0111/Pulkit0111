Motivated and efficient Full-stack web developer with a history of education in Mechanical Engineering and an interest in coding. Working with MERN stack and programming languages like JavaScript catalyzed my curiosity for web development. I have worked in collaborative environments demonstrating my coding and interpersonal skills to meet deadlines. Looking forward for some interesting and challenging opportunities.
